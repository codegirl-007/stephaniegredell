      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>MVP Development</h3>
          <p>From backend setup to authentication, billing, and deploy — I build fast, production-ready MVPs for startups and product teams.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Stripe Integrations</h3>
          <p>I’ve built checkout flows, usage-based billing, and multi-product platforms using Stripe APIs — and know how to get it live quickly.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Internal Tools</h3>
          <p>Need a dashboard, admin panel, or ops tool? I build fast-moving internal apps that actually get used by your team.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Backend Systems</h3>
          <p>I specialize in APIs, data models, services, and clean backend architecture — with a strong eye for performance and maintainability.</p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I embed quickly, communicate clearly, and ship fast. I work independently or with your team, async or paired.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer upfront payment agreements, clean contracts, and consistent build cycles. I’m based in California, work remote, and stay timezone aware.
